###Healthcare Readmission Data Analysis

##Overview:
Many low income families and individuals use Medicare and Medicaid services for their medical needs. The quality of medical services received and the prevention of wasted medical spending has been a growing concern especially of those who receive Medicare and Medicaid benefits. The federal government has enact legislation to ensure that Medicare and Medicaid recipients receive quality care while preventing wasteful medical spending.  Readmission rates are a good indicator of how effective the services that a healthcare facility provides. By exploring the Center of Medicare of Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) readmission data analysis can be done to determine how nationally we hold up with maintaining the quality of services for our Medicaid and Medicare recipients.

##Data Question
Is federal legislation improving quality of care for Medicare recipients in regards to readmissions, complications, and deaths? If so, which states are doing well and which are doing poorly? Are there any additional factors influencing the data.

##The data
For this project data from the CMS website was used. Two datasets were chosen that would support showing how nationally we are doing in terms of mainly quality to CMS standards. The first data set was CMS readmission reduction program data. This dataset provided nationally for all hospitals that service Medicare patients by state. The data from the CMS readmission reduction program was pretty clean there were some hospitals that did not report their data to CMS. The second dataset is CMS complications and death by state which provides information about trending complications and deaths at facilities across all 50 states. This dataset was pretty clean as well but also had some unreported data which resulted in missing values.

##Tools used
I used PowerBI with PowerQuery to perform the data analysis and build my dashboard.
